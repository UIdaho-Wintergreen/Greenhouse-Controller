To the teams that will have to improve this project, my only excuse was that I had a busy schedule when coding this. 
Sorry.

For setting a basic Apache2 server, PHP, and MySQL:

For using a python MySQL connector:
https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/developer-corner/mysql/connecting-to-mysql-using-python
I suggest sudo apt-get install python3-pymysql

In the case that the pi screams at you that you are missing a library, try importing whatever is in the code.

Basic instructions after downloading code and libraries: 

1. Edit config_sensors.json to fit your sensors/ details.
  - "temp_sensors": This section is for temperature sensors.
    - "type": Currently only supports DHT11.
  - "relays": This section is for relay information.
  - "soil_sensors": This section is for soil sensors.
    - Prior to setting up everything, calibrate soil sensor to get saturation levels.  
  - "sms_details": This section is for activating alarms.

Troubleshooting tips:
  - Allow access to localhost database with: 
    GRANT ALL ON root.* TO 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'ENTER_PASSWORD_HERE'; 
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
