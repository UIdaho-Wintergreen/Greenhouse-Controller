To the teams that will have to improve this project, my only excuse was that I had a busy schedule when coding this. 
Sorry.

Please note that this code utilizes a MySQL database and Google Spreadsheets implementation to store data, and uses Google email to send SMS alarms as well.
Fill in your information in the JSON file (some are filled in already). 

If your Google account has two factor authentication, you will need to use an app password to send SMS alerts. 
Follow the steps in the link below to do so and fill in the JSON file with the correct information.
https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en 

To enable editing to Google Sheets, follow the link below (omitting the Python part).
https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/07/read-and-update-google-spreadsheets-with-python/ 
Be sure to create the API key and store it in inside the Greenhouse-Controller directory, and store additional information in the JSON file. 

Edit the .conf file in the Server directory to contain your pi's IP address, then move it over to /etc/apache2/sites-available/.

In the case that the pi screams at you that you are missing a library, try importing whatever is in the code.

Basic instructions after downloading code and libraries: 

1. Edit config_sensors.json to fit your sensors/ details.
  - "temp_sensors": This section is for temperature sensors.
    - "type": Currently only supports DHT11.
  - "relays": This section is for relay information.
  - "soil_sensors": This section is for soil sensors.
    - Prior to setting up everything, calibrate soil sensor to get saturation levels. 
      -Run soil_sensor_calib.py from the SensorTests directory to do this.
  - "credentials": This section is for information needed to activate alarms, use Google Spreadsheets.

Troubleshooting tips:
  - Allow access to localhost database with: 
    GRANT ALL ON root.* TO 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'ENTER_PASSWORD_HERE'; 
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
