For setting a basic Apache2 server, PHP, and MySQL:

For using a python MySQL connector:
https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/developer-corner/mysql/connecting-to-mysql-using-python
I suggest sudo apt-get install python3-pymysql

In the case that the pi screams at you that you are missing a library, try importing whatever is in the code.
