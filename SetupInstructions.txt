The links below will be useful in setting up the various libraries and sensors.

For overall setup for CircuitPython libraries (Blinka):

For a basic introduction to Github for the Pi:

For setting a basic Apache2 server, PHP, and MySQL:

In the case that the pi screams at you that you are missing a library, try importing whatever is in the code.
