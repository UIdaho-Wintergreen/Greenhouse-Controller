The links below will be useful in setting up the various libraries and sensors.

For overall setup for CircuitPython libraries (Blinka):

For a basic introduction to Github for the Pi:
https://geektechstuff.com/2019/09/09/introduction-to-github-raspberry-pi/

For setting a basic Apache2 server, PHP, and MySQL:
https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/lamp-web-server-with-wordpress/2 

For using a python MySQL connector:
https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/developer-corner/mysql/connecting-to-mysql-using-python
I suggest sudo apt-get install python3-pymysql

In the case that the pi screams at you that you are missing a library, try importing whatever is in the code.
